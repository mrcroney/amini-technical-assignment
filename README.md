The notebook was created using Google Colab as that is what I am familiar with. It is recommended to upload it there and then you can run each cell individually and follow along with the thought process throughout the assignment. df is the dataframe used to do all data profiling. From there, df got copied into df_clean and all of the cleaning happened on that dataframe, df_clean is what the output cleaned_health_registry.csv was created from.
